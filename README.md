# Real-Time Object Detection Using OpenCV Python

The **Real-Time Object Detection project using OpenCV and Python** was developed as a simple experimental tool to detect common objects (COCO dataset) easily with your built-in webcam.

It uses OpenCV’s readNet method along with the external YOLOv3-tiny model (which can be upgraded to the full-sized YOLOv3 model).

OpenCV’s readNet method runs only on CPU (not GPU), making it very resource-intensive and therefore not optimal for large-scale AI projects.

This Object Detection implementation in Python applies an image and video classifier using pretrained YOLOv3 models.

The YOLOv3 models are based on the official YOLOv3 paper released in 2018, and the implementation originates from the Darknet framework.

Furthermore, this project includes an option to perform real-time classification using the webcam.
